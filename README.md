# Zero to Production Notes

## Chapter 1: Getting Started

### Install/update rustup:

```console
$ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y && source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
```

### CI, Formatting, etc.

```console
$ cargo llvm-cov
$ cargo fmt -- --check
$ cargo install cargo-audit
```

Fail the linter check if clippy emits any warnings

```console
$ cargo clippy -- -D warnings
```

```console
$ cargo watch -x check -x test -x run
```

### Toolchain

Install linker for macOS:

```console
$ brew install keith/formulae/ld64.lld
```

[mold/sold linker](https://github.com/rui314/mold) might be worth considering. Unsure of licesne situation and
usage considering updates with Xcode 15 that has a more improved linker now.

> We are considering relicensing the sold linker as free software rather than as
> a commercial product, given the recent developments with the official Apple
> linker. Since Apple's linker has gained speed, it's difficult to obtain a
> sufficient number of users to sustain this project.

With the confusing state of play with license I would opt for using mold only for
linux builds and ld64.lld for macOS builds.

Having said that, with the latest release of Xcode 15 on macOS, there is talk
that the new default `ld` linker is much faster for `Mach-O` targets (note,
`ld-prime` was the initial name for the new linker in Xcode 15 beta, but that
has now changed to be just `ld` and the _old_ version being called `ld-classic`.

## Chapter 2: Building An Email Newsletter

User Stories:

      - As a blog visitor,
      - I want to subscribe to the newsletter,
      - So that I can receive email updates when new content is published on the blog;

      - As the blog author,
      - I want to send an email to all my subscribers,
      - So that I can notify them when new content is published.

## Chapter 3: Sign Up A New Subscriber

1. Choose a web framework and get familiar with it;
2. Define our testing strategy;
3. Choose a crate to interact with our database (we will have to save those emails somewhere!);
4. Define how we want to manage changes to our database schemas over time (a.k.a. migrations);
5. Actually write some queries

```console
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:8000
Hello World!

```

`cargo expand` for expanding procedural macros, typicall requires `+nightly`
toolchain: can then run via `cargo +nightly expand` (and is installed via `cargo
install cargo-expand`)

```rust

```

```rust
// We need to mark `run` as public.
// It is no longer a binary entrypoint, therefore we can mark it as async
// without having to use any proc-macro incantation.
pub async fn run() -> Result<(), std::io::Error> {
    HttpServer::new(|| App::new().route("/health_check", web::get().to(health_check)))
        .bind("127.0.0.1:8000")?
        .run()
        .await
}
```

Port 0 is special-cased at the OS level: trying to bind port 0 will trigger an OS scan for an available port which
will then be bound to the application

```rust

    let server = zero2prod::run("127.0.0.1:0").expect("Failed to bind address");

```

#### Refocus

1. How to read data collected in a HTML form in actix-web (i.e. how do I parse the request body of a POST?);
2. What libraries are available to work with a PostgreSQL database in Rust (diesel vs sqlx vs tokio¬≠postgres);
3. How to setup and manage migrations for our database;
4. How to get our hands on a database connection in our API request handlers;
5. How to test for side-effects (a.k.a. stored data) in our integration tests;
6. How to avoid weird interactions between tests when working with a database.

#### Summary

- actix-web extractors and HTML forms
- (de)serialisation with `serde`
- overview of the available database crates in the Rust ecosystem:
- fundamentals of `sqlx`

##### üîë Key Section

3.10.1 Test Isolation

Your database is a gigantic global variable: all your tests are interacting with
it and whatever they leave behind will be available to other tests in the suite
as well as to the following test runs. This is precisely what happened to us a
moment ago: our first test run commanded our application to register a new
subscriber with `ursula_le_guin@gmail.com` as their email; the application
obliged. When we re-ran our test suite we tried again to perform another
`INSERT` using the same email, but our `UNIQUE` constraint on the email column
raised a unique `key violation` and rejected the query,forcing the application
to return us a `500 INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`.

You really do not want to have _any_ kind of interaction
between your tests: it makes your test runs nondeterministic and it leads down
the line to spurious test failures that are extremely tricky to hunt down and
fix.

There are two techniques I am aware of to ensure test isolation when
interacting with a relational database in a test:

1. wrap the whole test in a SQL transaction and rollback at the end of it
2. spin up a brand-new logical database for each integration test.

The first is clever and will generally be faster: rolling back a SQL transaction
takes less time than spinning up a new logical database. It works quite well
when writing unit tests for your queries but it is tricky to pull off in an
integration test like ours: our application will borrow a PgConnection from a
PgPool and we have no way to ‚Äúcapture‚Äù that connection in a SQL transaction
context. Which leads us to the second option: potentially slower, yet much
easier to implement.

How? Before each test run, we want to:

1. create a new logical database with a unique name;
2. run database migrations on it.

The best place to do this is spawn_app, before launching our actix-web test
application (see. `tests/health_check.rs`)

`configuration.database.connection_string()` uses the database_name specified in
our configura¬≠tion.yaml file - the same for all tests. Let‚Äôs randomise it with
`uuid`.

`cargo test` will fail: there is no database ready to accept connections using
the name we generated. We need to create it! In order to issue a `CREATE
DATABASE` command we need to connect to the Postgres instance, which implies
connecting to a database that already exists. We‚Äôll use the postgres database
for this purpose, the one that comes by default with a Postgres installation.
It‚Äôs often referred to as the ‚Äúmaintenance database‚Äù for this reason

`sqlx::migrate!` is the same macro used by `sqlx-cli` when executing `sqlx
migrate run` - no need to throw bash scripts into the mix to achieve the same
result

You might have noticed that we do not perform any clean-up step at the end of
our tests - the logical databases we create are not being deleted. This is
intentional: we could add a clean-up step, but our Postgres instance is used
only for test purposes and it‚Äôs easy enough to restart it if, after hundreds of
test runs, performance starts to suffer due to the number of lingering (almost
empty) databases.

##### Key Topics

1. Facade Pattern
2. Structured Logging

_Lifetime of the span_

‚Ä¢ We enter the span(->);
‚Ä¢ We execute the INSERT query;
‚Ä¢ We exit the span (<-);
‚Ä¢ We finally close the span (--).

**Removing Unused Dependencies**: `cargo install cargo-udeps`, `cargo +nightly
udeps`

**Protect Your Secrets**: `secrecy`

```toml
# [...]
[dependencies]
secrecy = { version = "0.8", features = ["serde"] }
# [...]
```

**Leveraging CI and Docker**

> A Dockerfile is a recipe for your application environment.
> They are organised in layers: you start from a base image (usually an OS
> enriched with a programming language toolchain) and execute a series of commands
> (COPY, RUN, etc.), one after the other, to build the environment you need.

```bash
# We use the latest Rust stable release as base image
FROM rust:1.80.1
# Let's switch our working directory to `app` (equivalent to `cd app`)
# The `app` folder will be created for us by Docker in case it does not
# exist already.
WORKDIR /app
# Install the required system dependencies for our linking configuration RUN apt
update && apt install lld clang -y
# Copy all files from our working environment to our Docker image
COPY . .
# Let's build our binary!
# We'll use the release profile to make it faaaast
RUN cargo build --release
# When `docker run` is executed, launch the binary!
ENTRYPOINT ["./target/release/zero2prod"]
```

```console
# Build a docker image tagged as "zero2prod" according to the recipe
# specified in `Dockerfile`
docker build --tag zero2prod .
```

_Use the offline mode for `sqlx`._

```console
# We use `--all-targets` to include the queries
# defined in our integration tests
cargo sqlx prepare --workspace -- --all-targets

query data written to `.sqlx` in the workspace root;
please check this into version control
```

```bash
...
ENV SQLX_OFFLINE true
...
```

**Optimising Our Docker Image**

There are two optimisations we can make to our Dockerfile to make our life
easier going forward:

- Smaller image size for faster usage;
- Docker layer caching for faster builds.

We can use the bare operating system as base image (`debian:bookworm-slim`) for
our runtime stage:

```bash

# [...]

# Runtime stage

FROM debian:bookworm-slim AS runtime
WORKDIR /app

# Install OpenSSL - it is dynamically linked by some of our dependencies
# Install ca-certificates - it is needed to verify TLS certificates
# when establishing HTTPS connections
RUN apt-get update -y \
  && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends openssl ca-certificates \
  # Clean up
  && apt-get autoremove -y \
  && apt-get clean -y \
  && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/\*
COPY --from=builder /app/target/release/zero2prod zero2prod
COPY configuration configuration
ENV APP_ENVIRONMENT production
ENTRYPOINT ["./zero2prod"]
```

We could go even smaller by using rust:1.80.1-alpine, but we would have to
cross-compile to the linux-musl target - out of scope for now. Check out
[rust-musl-builder](https://github.com/clux/muslrust) if you are interested in
generating tiny Docker images. Another option to reduce the size of our binary
further is stripping symbols from it - you can find more information about it
[here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/profiles.html#strip)

> rustc statically links all Rust code but dynamically links libc from the
> underlying system if you are using the Rust standard library. You can get a

> supported platforms and targets for more information.

Rust‚Äôs binaries are statically linked - we do not need to keep the source code
or intermediate compilation artefacts around to run the binary, it is entirely
self-contained.

This plays nicely with multi-stage builds, a useful Docker feature. We can split
our build in two stages:

- A builder stage, to generate a compiled binary;
- A runtime stage, to run the binary.

You can think of each stage as its own Docker image with its own caching - they
only interact with each other when using the `COPY --from` statement.
